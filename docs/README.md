# Shortbloke's Home Assistant Configuration Files [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shortbloke/home_assistant_config.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shortbloke/home_assistant_config)

This is my currently active set of configuration files for my [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) running on Raspberry Pi.
If you are intested in following my progress be sure ⭐️ Star this repository and check out [my blog](https://www.martinrowan.co.uk).

### Configuration File Status 
Each commit triggers a deployment to the latest home assistant version with Python 3.6. This is done though TravisCI. If this sucessfully passes, then my Pi will update itself with the latest configuration automatically.

## Core Hardware of Home Assistant Hub
 - [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](http://amzn.to/2hI9tyc) - Core control system, running Raspbian.
 - [RFXCOM RFXtrx433E](http://amzn.to/2wFwO63) - Enables RX/TX of 433Mhz signals over a range of protocols.
   - Note: Lots of different protocols in use on 433Mhz which may need to be enabled via a management utility. 433Mhz lacks any real security. If you capture the code you can control the device, as I found out by accidentally controlling a neighbour's plug-in sockets.
 - [Aeotec Z-Stick Gen5 (ZW090)](http://amzn.to/2wrrgwI) - Provides interface to Z-Wave Mesh Network devices.
 - Plus case, Power Supply and MicroSD Card.
